## How we designed Meteor Crush
- The goal of the development was to make a smooth playing and accesible game. 
- The main focus was to achieve a polished gamelay experience using highy efficient code.
- Aseprite and Dall-E were used in making the UI and Game Objects. 
- For game design and logic Unity(2020.3.46f1) was used to assemble all assets and add code. 
- Game Programming was achieved through Visual Studio Code by using C# to make generic, optimized and reusable code, object pooling aws implemented on all projectiles to reduce CPU load.
- FL Studio was used to make Synthwave type Music using a sample pack. The internet as well as various sample packs were used to otain sound effects for the game.
- Game Testing:
	- Movement Testing: Using the most optimal movement mechanic out of 3 types tested.
	- Difficulty Testing - Taking all 4 factors given in the design document, we created a difficulty graph.
- The UI and other aspects can be improved through further developments.
